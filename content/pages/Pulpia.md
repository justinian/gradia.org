Pulpia is a bustling trade town nestled among the hills and valleys that roughly define [Narin](/pages/Narin)'s northern border with [Uzan](/pages/Uzan). Situated along a major trade route, the town is a hub of commercial activity, with merchants, traders, and travelers passing through on a regular basis.

The town itself is built on a gentle slope, with narrow streets and alleys winding up and down the hillside. The buildings are mostly made of wood and stone, with colorful facades and tiled roofs that give the town a cheerful and vibrant feel. The central square is a lively and bustling place, filled with the sounds of traders hawking their wares and travelers bargaining for the best prices.

Pulpia is known for its vibrant market, which is held twice a week in the town square. Here, merchants from all over the region come to sell their goods, from spices and textiles to rare herbs and exotic animals. The market is a riot of color and sound, with vendors shouting out their prices and haggling with customers, while the smells of roasting meats and baking breads waft through the air.

Despite its small size, Pulpia has a surprising amount of cultural richness. The town is home to several small churches and chapels, each with its own unique history and architectural style. A small college has even been started here, initially focused on agricultural advancement but recently branching into theology and history.

Pulpia is also a strategic location for the empire, with sightlines that allow its garrison plenty of advance notice of Uzani raids. The surrounding countryside is also a major source of food for the province, its rolling hills dotted with farms and vineyards which also produce some of the finest wines and cheeses in the region.
