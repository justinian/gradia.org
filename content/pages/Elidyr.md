The lone [Einir](/pages/Einir) on the [Thalaric Council](/pages/Thalarion), Elidyr has held their seat almost as long as [Zhoster](/pages/Zhoster). Elidyr keeps themself out of the public eye, and so not too much is known about them. Perhaps the biggest insight the public has into Elidyr is their love for their home [Eindonallan](/pages/Eindonallan), having sent much Thalaric aid to the city after it was attacked in 914~IA~. Many of Thalarion's current Einir population came to the city as refugees during that time, and still feel they owe a debt to Elidyr for their help.
