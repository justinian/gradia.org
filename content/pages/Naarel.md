Naarel was the most powerful of the dark gods in Gradia before [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering). He ruled and drew his power from the plane of negative energy.

In the fifth century before 0~IA~, Naarel began a war to cleanse all life from the material plane and leave nothing but undeath and spirit. Naarel was defeated before he could bring about this outcome by [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir) and his companions, who banished him from the world and sealed the prime material plane away from the outer planes.
