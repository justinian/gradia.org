Beyond the mountains of the [Nauglimir](/pages/Nauglimir), beyond the
[Wildlands](/pages/Wildlands), beyond even the scorched savannahs of
[Zagarka](/pages/Zagarka), lies the sun-blasted Kingdom of Rygalta. Despite much
of its land being desert, Rygalta is known as an oasis for travellers, due in
part to hospitality being a strong theme in Rygaltan culture.

# Geography and Climate

Most of Rygalta's cities lie in the savannahs along the coast of the Great
Northern Sea, including its current capitol - the famed _Shining City_,
[Alhamad](/pages/Alhamad). The golden towers of Alhamad gleam in the sun, the
jewel of one of the oldest civilizations in known Gradia.

Much of inland Rygalta is desert, though swaths of savannah mark the land where
rivers cut through from the south. Most habitable land in the kingdom lies
either along these rivers or the coast.

# Royal Family

The King of Rygalta is both political leader and spiritual leader, acting as
high priest in a sun-focused form of [Essentialism](/pages/Essentialism),
however this has become mostly symbolic over the generations. The main source of
power for the royal family is their wealth &mdash; it is vast, even compared to
other powerful dynasties. Much of this wealth comes from the mines of the
northern savannahs of Rygalta - famously rich in gold and precious gems - 
which are mostly owned by the royal family.

# History

## War with Xar

Rygalta is one of the few nations in Gradia that is a military match for
[Xar](/pages/Xar), both on land and at sea. From the third century to the late
ninth century, the two powers were at war more often than not as Xar's
expansionist regieme continuously tried to encroach on Rygaltan territory.
The fighting only intensified after [Thalarion](/pages/Thalarion) stopped
Xar's westward expansion by declaring the Protectorate.

However, in 892~IA~, the two states signed an armistice and declared a neutral
borderland between them which both agreed to was to remain demilitarized.
