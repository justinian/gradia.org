Beyond the mountains of the [Nauglimir](/pages/Nauglimir), beyond the [Wildlands](/pages/Wildlands), beyond even the scorched savannahs of [Zagarka](/pages/Zagarka), lies the sun-blasted Kingdom of Rygalta. Despite much of its land being desert, Rygalta is known as an oasis for travellers, due in part to hospitality being a strong theme in Rygaltan culture.

Most of Rygalta's cities lie along the coast of the Great Northern Sea, including its current capitol, the famed Alhamad, City of Splendor. The golden towers of Alhamad gleam in the sun, the jewel of one of the oldest civilizations in known Gradia.

The King of Rygalta is both political leader and spiritual leader, acting as high priest in a sun-focused form of [Essentialism](/pages/Essentialism).
