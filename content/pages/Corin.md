Corin is a costal kingdom that lies between the [Lorimar Sea](/pages/Lorimar-Sea)
and the mountains. It's said that as the first tribes of humans migrated
north from the Lorimar Sea to settle in what is now [Narin](/pages/Narin), many
smaller groups broke off to remain in the beautiful landscapes of what has
become the Kingdom of Corin. Small fiefdoms eventually sprung up from
agricultural and fishing settlements, becoming a loose-knit whole that led to a
history of very republican Corin sovereignty.

Corin shares a long land border in the northwest with the Empire of Narin, and
has been conquered twice by Narin throughout its history. Currently Corin is
nominally a vassal state of the empire, but some argue that the emperor has no
real sway in Corin.
