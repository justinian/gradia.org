The Einir are a humanoid race closely related to the [Alfir](/pages/Alfir). Generally slightly shorter than human height and of slightly lighter builds, the Alfir look more similar to humans than their southern cousins. They have elongated, pointed ears, and harsher facial features than humans. Their skin and hair are of similar ranges of colors to humans, though more colorful outliers are not unheard of. Einir were once long-lived, many living over 800 years - but after [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering), a typical lifespan is rarely more than 250 years.

Many Einir come from [Eindonallan](/pages/Eindonallan), though they can be found all over the world. Culturally, the Einir tend to consider themselves more "civilized" than the wilder Alfir, and often resent any comparison. Einir culture (at least in Eidnonallan) tends to value learning and contemplation, with many Einir devoting their especially long lives solely to philosophical pursuits.
