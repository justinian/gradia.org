Var Gurum is a long-ruined [Kmekh](/pages/Kmekh) outpost located in the
[Rookspine Mountains](/pages/Rookspine-Mountains) south of
[Greade](/pages/Greade).

Recently, the [Awoken Eye](/pages/Awoken-Eye) excavated
much of Var Gurum, believing it to be the location of the tomb of
[Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir). Instead, they found the resting place of
[Marost](/pages/Marost).
