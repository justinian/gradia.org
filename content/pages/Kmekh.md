Stout, dense, and strong, the Kmekh /ˈkmeχ/ peoples of Gradia generally stand
between four and five feet in height, with a stockier build than humans or
halflings. Kmekh hair colors are mostly similar to those of humans, though their
hair tends to turn grey or white much earlier in their lifespans than other
humanoids.

Kmekh mostly dwell in their vast underground mountain cities in the
[Rookspine Mountains](/pages/Rookspine-Mountains) known as the
[Nauglimir](/pages/Nauglimir). Not nearly as insular and single-minded as they
are stereotyped to be, the Kmekh are just as likely to wander and seek knowledge
as any other race - they're just also better at doing it underground than most
other races. The Kmekh are also said to be innate craftsmen, but the reality is
that their culture values hard work and craftsmanship, and such values tend to
be instilled into their children from an early age.

Most of the Kmekh of the Nauglimir - and many beyond its borders - worship
[Zmix̂oda The Hammersmith](/pages/Zmix̂oda), said to be creator of their kind.
Some non-Kmekh scholars believe he may be an aspect of the
[Underlord](/pages/Essentialism#the-underlord) or a related god, which most
Kmekh find insulting at best.

Most, but not all, Kmekh speak [Kankhri][kh].
