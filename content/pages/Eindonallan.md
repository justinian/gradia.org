In a time before the age of humanity, Eindonallan was the capitol city of a
great [Einir](/pages/Einir) kingdom. As the other peoples of Gradia emerged and
claimed lands for themselves, Eindonallan grew in influence. Other peoples
sought out the Einir for their wisdom, or attempted to curry favor with
Eindonallan as a sign of status among other nations.

After [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering), the power of the Einir waned, and with
their remaining magicks they secluded themselves and hid their city from
outsiders. The great kingdom became a mere city-state, all but forgotten from
the world. But after the long ages, darkness struck in 912~IA~ - the city was
razed and many of its inhabitants killed as dark elves burned the forests to
blot out the sun and attacked Eindonallan. The human town of [Dol
Kor](/pages/Dol-Kor) in [Illyria](/pages/Illyria) took in many of the refugees,
kindling a new bond between Humans and [Einir](/pages/Einir). For the past
quarter century, the city has been rebuilding. While much of the splendor of the
great city has been restored, the wounds are clearly still fresh - both in the
city and for the Einir.
