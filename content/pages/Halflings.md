Halflings are a race of humanoids, generally standing around three and a half feet tall. Their skin tones vary from pale peach to dark umber, and their hair, much like humans, varies from platinum blonde or red to black.

Halfling lands have long since been conquered or co-opted by Humans. There are no predominantly Halfling lands, but they have integrated quite well into Human societies and are generally well-accepted by their Human neighbors. The Halflings don't even have their own word for their people, instead just using the Human term "halfling." But they are a tight-knit people - in any Human settlement bigger than a small town, there is likely to be a community of halflings who will happily embrace their kin.
