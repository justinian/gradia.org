Marost is one of the original disciples of [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir), who
slumbers, lost to time, beneath the [Kmekh](/pages/Kmekh) ruins of
[Var Gurum](/pages/Var-Gurum). In life she was an [Alfir](/pages/Alfir) with pale
skin and hair, and she looks much the same now.

Before meeting Malat-ir, Marost was the scion of a powerful Alfir noble house.
She helped lead her house's army to crush a rival house, wiping out all
surviving members of their primary branch. Seeing the effects of her actions,
she was wracked with guilt. She disavowed her family and travelled north,
joining the Golden Order - an order of the Sun King devoted to helping those in
need. Travelling with Malat-ir, she constantly felt the weight of her past
actions, and attempted to atone for her past life. After Malat-ir, she wandered
the continent ever-vigilant, and her devotion to selflessness made her a friend
of many peoples.

## Tomb at Var Gurum

It was intended that the Kmekh in the outpost were to keep watch over the region
and wake her should there be any great disturbance. But Var Gurum fell, and
Marost was not awakened. For long centuries she slept, and as she did, the
dreams of [Ialdabaoth](/pages/Ialdabaoth) seeped into her mind. Not completely
turned to the madness, but not completely herself, an awoken Marost would be
chaos and unpredictable.
