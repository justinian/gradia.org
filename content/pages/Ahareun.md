The ancient black dragon Ahareun (Kankhri: /aha Å\'eun/) is incredibly old. She fought for [Naarel](/pages/Naarel) against the group led by [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir) duing the battle of [Muir Dorosh](/pages/Nauglimir). Ahareun was arrogant, and lost her right eye in battle against [Marost](/pages/Marost).

Already evil-hearted and cruel, Ahareun became even moreso after losing her eye. With Naarel defeated, Ahareun considered herself the greatest being in the world. She took the ruins of the Black Citadel in the [Wyrdlands](/pages/Wyrdlands) as her lair, and became a scourge upon northern Gradia for centuries.
