The Wyrdlands are a region south of [Xar](/pages/Xar) where the fabric of reality has been altered by immensely strong magics. The final battle between [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir) and [Naarel](/pages/Naarel), which caused [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering) happened here, doing irreperable damage to the land and even reality itself.
