The Divine Empire of Xar (Kado Tezu Xara) is an enigma to those not born into
it. The immortal god-queen Xar demands strict obedience from her citizens, and
the borders are closed to outsiders.

What little outsiders do know comes as roundabout rumors, but always seems
completely alien compared to life on the rest of the continent.  Those who have
survived encounters with the Xaran military tell stories of the Xarans raising
giant beetles, both as war beasts and beasts of burden, as well as for their
carapaces, from which they craft the distinctive armor of the Xaran
noble-warrior class.

# History

Xarans seem to be human, but don't share a lineage with any other group in
Western Gradia. Their word for their people is _Age_, which can also be
translated as 'settler'. Their people arrived on the shores of what is now Xar
over a millenium ago.

Not long after [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering), the God-Queen rose to power
and declared herself rightful ruler of the entire continent. The borders of her
rule have expanded many times due to campaigns of expansion from the third
through the ninth century IA, as her powerful insectoid war machines swept over
land and sea. Eventually though, they reached an uneasy equilibrium as the Xaran
forces ran first into the magical might of [Thalarion](/pages/Thalarion) to the
west, and later agreed to an armistice with [Rygalta](/pages/Rygalta) to the
east.
