Alfheim, land of the [Alfir](/pages/Alfir), is a land almost constantly
frozen under snow and ice. Only during the exceptionally long days of summer do
parts of the kingdom thaw - but the winters are harsh, and the sun barely gets
over the horizon. Somehow, the Alfir not only survive, but thrive in these
frozen forests. It is said that their white cities and towers were once
magnificent to behold, and that many ruins still are - should you survive a
journey to see them.


# Geography and Climate

{{< map target=358,800 zoom=1 >}}

Alfheim occupies the southeastern tip of the continent, though most of its
inland borders are vague at best. Vast stretches of untouched taiga reach from
the frozen shores up to the foothills that roughly outline Alfheim's northern
and eastern extents.

All is not completely frozen solid, however. Frigid rivers pool into Lake Sshan,
the largest lake on the continent. And around Sshan, lie the ruins of the
once-great Alfir empire.

Alfheim lies so far south that during the winter, the sun rises for just a few
hours a day; few things survive the harsh cold without sunlight. In the summer,
the days are eerily long - and while still cold, ice and snow lessen, and life
awakens in the forests.

# Culture

Many scholars who have never actually visited Alfheim will tell you that the
Alfir are nomadic, but this is not strictly true. While the great cities of
their former empire are no more, there are still many permanent Alfiri
settlements all over Alfheim. Many Alfir will leave their homes on long hunting
expeditions during the summer months, however. These hunts, combined with the
common practice of hiding their settlements from outsiders, often lead outsiders
to underestimate the rich culture of the Alfir.
