The Kvakhmir Mountain Range, known as _"Kvakhmir Yokh"_ in Kankhri, meaning "The
Mountains at the Edge of the World," is a distinct spur of the larger Rookspine
Mountain Range, located in east-central Gradia. Unlike the towering peaks of the
Rookspine, the Kvakhmir Mountains are lower in elevation and less dramatic in
their topography. However, they are notable for their extensive glaciers and
cold, arid landscapes that create a stark and rugged beauty.

The Kvakhmir Mountains are most renowned as the home of five of the remaining
six [Nauglimir](/pages/Nauglimir) city-states. The mountains provide not only a
natural fortress for these city-states but also abundant resources, including
precious metals and stone, which have been skillfully extracted and utilized by
the [Kmekh](/pages/Kmekh) for centuries.
