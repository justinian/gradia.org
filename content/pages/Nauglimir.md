The Nauglimir are a string of Kmekh(/pages/Kmekh) city states, built into the [Rookspine Mountains](/pages/Rookspine-Mountains), each ruled by a separate Kmekh king (or _Lim_).

{{< map target=760,700 zoom=0.5 offset=1 >}}

The six remaining cities of the Nauglimir are:

- **Muir Kadak**, the city of stone is by far the largest of the Nauglimir. When
  outsiders speak of the Nauglimir, they often mean only Muir Kadak, and not the
  cities as a group.
- **Muir Karfash**, the city of hammers, is the next largest. renowned for its
  artisans. Located near the [Illyrian](/pages/Illyria) border, Muir Karfash
  trades heavily with the humans of the region. When outsiders are fortunate
  enough to own _Kmekhoti_ goods, it's likely that they came from Muir Karfash.
- **Muir Pakosh**, the city of crystal, has some of the most extensive mines on
  the continent.
- **Muir Baltan**, the city of winds, is unique for a Kmekh city in that it is
  mostly above ground. Close to the wildlands, Muir Baltan serves as a lookout and
  first line of defense against raiders approaching Kmekh lands.
- **Muir Gudak**, the city of coin, named so both for its gold mines, but also
  for its great market squares.
- **Muir Patagal**, the city of diamond, once overrun by hordes from the
  underground depths, is being rebuilt and reclaimed under the leadership of a
  new Lim.

Legends tell of a lost city of the Nauglimir, _Muir Dorosh_, city of gold, which
came to be known as _Muir Duerga_, city of betrayal. It is not permitted among
the Kmekh to speak of Muir Dorosh, but in the long dirges and ballads that serve
as the record of their history, there are traces of memory that a keen ear can
still catch.
