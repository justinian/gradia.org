The Nauglimir are a collection of [Kmekh](/pages/Kmekh) city-states, primarily
located in the [Kvakhmir Mountains](/pages/Kvakhmir-Mountains). Though often
referred to collectively, these cities are separate sovereign states, each
governed by a different Kmekh king, known as a _Lim_. The cities of the
Nauglimir maintain close alliances on most issues, presenting a united front
while preserving their individual autonomy.

# The Six Cities

{{< map target=760,700 zoom=0.5 offset=1 >}}

## Muir Kadak

**Muir Kadak**, the city of stone, is the largest and most prominent of the
Nauglimir. Outsiders often equate the entire Nauglimir with Muir Kadak, given
its size and influence. The city's massive stone structures and bustling
markets epitomize the grandeur of the Kmekh civilization.

## Muir Karfash

**Muir Karfash**, the city of hammers, is renowned for its skilled artisans and
craftsmen. Situated near the [Illyrian](/pages/Illyria) border, it engages in
extensive trade with the humans of the region. When outsiders possess _Kmekhoti_
goods, they are likely from Muir Karfash, reflecting the city's reputation for
quality and craftsmanship.

## Muir Pakosh

**Muir Pakosh**, the city of crystal, is notable for its extensive mines, some
of the most productive on the continent. The only Nauglimir city located in the
[Rookspine Mountains](/pages/Rookspine-Mountains), Muir Pakosh is a vital source
of minerals and gemstones, contributing significantly to the wealth and power of
the Nauglimir.

## Muir Baltan

**Muir Baltan**, the city of winds, is unique among Kmekh cities for being
mostly above ground. Close to the wildlands, it serves as a crucial lookout and
first line of defense against raiders. Its exposed position requires constant
vigilance, and its inhabitants are known for their resilience and fortitude.

## Muir Gudak

**Muir Gudak**, the city of coin, is named both for its lucrative gold mines and
its bustling market squares. The city's economy thrives on trade, with
merchants from all over Gradia seeking the wealth and goods of Muir Gudak.

## Muir Patagal

**Muir Patagal**, the city of diamond, is currently undergoing a renaissance.
Once overrun by hordes from the underground depths, it is being rebuilt under
the leadership of a new Lim. The city’s reconstruction symbolizes the
resilience and enduring spirit of the Kmekh people.

## Legends of Muir Dorosh

Legends speak of a lost city, **Muir Dorosh**, known as the city of gold. This
city, later called **Muir Duerga**, city of betrayal, is shrouded in mystery and
sorrow. It is forbidden to speak of Muir Dorosh among the Kmekh, yet traces of
its story linger in the dirges and ballads that recount their history, hinting
at a tragic past.

## Etymology

The name "Nauglimir" derives from the Kmekh language, Kankhri. The first Kmekh
settlers named the mountain range _Kvakhmir Yokh_, meaning "mountains at the
edge of the world." As they established their cities, they referred to them
collectively as _Nauglim Mir_, or "remote kingdoms" (literally, "thrones at the
edge"), to distinguish them from their homelands in the east. Over time, this
term evolved into "Nauglimir," the name by which these kingdoms are known today.
