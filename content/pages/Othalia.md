Tall and strong, Othalians often stand a head taller than most other humans. They are renowned for their skill at hunting and sailing, and for their prowess as warriors. Most of the Jarldoms of Othalia are dense boreal forests, blanketed with snow for much of the year. The southernmost territories are colder still, and even the sun does not spend much time there.

The Jarls of Othalia usually pay fealty to a High King, and war with each other for the position when there is no High King. Now is one of those times, as High King Gjermund has passed, and the Jarls have begun readying for battle.
