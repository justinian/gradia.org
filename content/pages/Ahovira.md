Ahovira is both the court wizard to the Emperor [Narin](/pages/Narin), and also
a member of the [Thalaric Council](/pages/Thalarion). With the coronation of
Vileminna I, she has now been court wizard to three reigning Narin emperors. She
splits her time between Thalarion and Narinth, and depsite the Emperor's faith
in her, much of the public on both sides begrudge her for her split loyalties.
