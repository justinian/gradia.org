Not much is known about Anloeb, as her subterranean priests and followers don't tend to come to the surface on peaceful terms. And if they do, they are often hunted by their own kind. As far as surface-dwelling scholars can tell, Anloeb seems to be a younger god - somehow she came to be _after_ [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering). There is much debate around if or how this can be true; if it is, it hints that either the Sundering is not total, or that new gods can be born within its bounds.

The subterranean peoples of the dark places attribute many aspects to Anloeb, seeing her as the center of their monotheistic religion. But her strongest aspects seem to be those of power and conquest - perhaps a reflection of the cultures of those that make their home in the darkness.
