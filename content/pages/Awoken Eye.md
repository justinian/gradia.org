_The Awoken Eye_ was a name used by at least two cults throughout history: a
cult in [Rygalta](/pages/Rygalta) in the fifth century IA, and one in western
Gradia in the ninth century IA.

# Original Awoken Eye

What little is known of the original Awoken Eye comes from Rygaltan records.
They are said to have been heretics against the state religion of the kingdom,
even going so far as to attack and kill many of the king's missionaries.

The cult was eventually crushed by the king's armies, but at a great cost.

# Latter Awoken Eye

The purpose and leadership of the newer Awoken Eye is not yet clear. They appear
to be searching for the tomb of [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir), under the guidance
of a man named [Rael-el](/pages/Rael-el).

## Operation at Var Gurum

The Awoken Eye has found the [Kmekh](/pages/Kmekh) ruin of [Var
Gurum](/pages/Var-Gurum) in the mountains, south along the river from
[Biraz](/pages/Biraz). They have built an encampment the size of a large town
around the entrance. They believe the ruin may have been built over the tomb of
[Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir). The [Lower Narbun Trading Co.](/pages/LNTC) has
been ferrying their stolen goods up the river on cogs from Biraz to build and
supply the camp.
