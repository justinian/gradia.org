Zhiatash was a human mage from Rygalta, and a member of the [Thalarion](/pages/Thalarion) until her murder in 943~IA~. An extremely tall and stately dark-skinned woman, Zhiatash was thought to be the wealthiest of the Councillors, due to her connections to the royal family of [Rygalta](/pages/Rygalta).

During Zhiatash's funeral, the Cathedral of the Moon in Thalarion was devestated by a massive explosion. Scholars have called it the worst disaster in Thalarion's history to date. Due to the explosion, however, a group of adventurers were able to discover that Zhiatash's body was a fake. She appears to have faked her own death, but her motives are unknown.
