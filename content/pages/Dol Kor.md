Dol Kor is a small borderland town on the highway between the city of
[Illyria](/pages/Illyria) and the [Einir](/pages/Einir) kingdom of
[Eindonallan](/pages/Eindonallan). Small as it is, the town has been prospering
in recent years as Illyrians make pilgrimages to Dol Kor to honor the [Saint of
Flames](/pages/Saint-of-Flames).

# History

Originally called _Dol Montur_ (or "Montur's Hill") after the large hill just
north of town, Dol Kor was given its current name by the Saint of Flames in
911~IA~, in memory of his companion and friend [Kor](/pages/Kor). It's said
that before his untimely end, the Saint of Flames had planned to settle in Dol
Kor after the liberation of Illyria.

The small town of Dol Kor has had an outsized impact on Human-Einir relations,
especially due to the events surrounding two battles during the Illyrian
struggle for independence from [Narin](Narin).

Upon the renaming of the town, a statue of Kor was built in the main square.
It depicts Kor, gravely wounded, rising to his feet to continue fighting off
the Orkol.

## The Battle of Dol Montur

In 910~IA~, an overwhelming force of [Orkol](/pages/Orkol) warbands swept
northward through the eastern reaches of Illyria. It is unknown whether these
warbands were mercenaries working for Narin, or merely taking advantage of the
chaos for themselves.

The Saint of Flames and his companions were in Dol Montur when the Orkol arrived
at the town, having just returned from beseeching Eindonallan for aid in the
struggle against Narin. The heroes were able to stave off the destruction of the
town long enough for much of the population to escape, whom they then led to
seek asylum in Eindonallan.

While the Orkol warbands were successful in razing the town, the large number of
survivors meant that the townsfolk were eventually able to rebuild, with help from
the Einir.

## The Battle of Eindonallan

In the early days of 911~IA~, the city of Eindonallan was attacked by a coalition
force of subterranean nations. There have even been claims that the coalition
forces had an allied dragon fighting with them. The result of the battle was that
the city (and much of the surrounding forest) was almost completely burned to the
ground. Illyria contributed a great deal of aid to Eindonallan's rebuilding, but
it was the people of Dol Kor that were at the forefront, helping the Einir and
opening their homes to the displaced.

To this day, Dol Kor has more Einir inhabitants per capita than any other human
settlement.
