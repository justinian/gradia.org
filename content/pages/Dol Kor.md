# History

Originally known as _Dol Montur_, or "Montur's Hill," after the prominent hill
just north of the town, Dol Kor received its current name from the Saint of
Flames in 912~IA~. This renaming was a tribute to his loyal companion and
friend, [Kor](/pages/Kor). It is believed that the Saint of Flames had intended
to settle in Dol Kor after the liberation of Illyria, a testament to the town's
significance in his life. To commemorate Kor, a statue stands in the main
square, depicting him, gravely wounded yet resolutely rising to continue the
fight against the Orkol.

## The Battle of Dol Montur

In 910~IA~, Dol Montur found itself in the path of a massive
[Orkol](/pages/Orkol) warband invasion. Whether these warbands were mercenaries
hired by [Narin](/pages/Narin) or opportunistic raiders remains unclear. The
Saint of Flames and his companions, returning from Eindonallan where they sought
assistance against Narin, were present in Dol Montur during the assault. Their
heroic efforts delayed the Orkol long enough to evacuate much of the population,
leading them to safety in Eindonallan. Although the town was eventually razed,
the high number of survivors allowed for a significant reconstruction effort,
aided by the Einir.

## The Battle of Eindonallan

In early 912~IA~, Eindonallan faced a devastating attack by a coalition of
subterranean nations, with rumors suggesting the involvement of a dragon. The
city and much of the surrounding forest were nearly obliterated by fire. Dol
Kor's inhabitants, demonstrating extraordinary solidarity, played a crucial role
in the rebuilding efforts. They provided substantial aid and opened their homes
to the displaced Einir, fostering a strong bond between the two communities.

## Post-Narin Dol Kor

Today, Dol Kor is a testament to resilience and unity. The town boasts a higher
concentration of Einir residents than any other human settlement, reflecting its
pivotal role in bridging the human and Einir communities. Pilgrims continue to
visit, drawn by the legacy of the Saint of Flames and the town's rich history.
