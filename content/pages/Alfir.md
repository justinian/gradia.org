The Alfir are a humanoid race closely related to the [Einir](/pages/Einir).
Generally a head shorter than human height with lighter builds, the Alfir have a
distinct look to them. Their skin ranges from white or pale peach to light grey
in tone, and their hair is often a light white or grey, though black or light
jewel tones are less common possibilities. Their ears are quite long and
pointed, and their facial features are often harshly angular, even moreso than
their Einir cousins. Alfir were once long-lived, with lifespans of 500-600 years -
but since [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering), Alfir lifespans are typically
between 170-200 years.

Most Alfir live in the frozen south, in and around the forests of
[Alfheim](/pages/Alfheim). Their culture tends to be insular, though individuals
leaving their homelands and mingling with other cultures is not uncommon.
