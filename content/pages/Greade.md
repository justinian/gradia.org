Nestled between the mountains and the Bay of Kell lies Greade. Home of stout,
hardworking folk, Greade is a peaceful land, and its citizens prefer to keep it
that way. Long ago, Greade was conquered by the [Empire of Narin](/pages/Narin)
in one of the bloodiest wars of the early imperial era. Since then, the cultural
attitudes of Greadans turned away from war - they far prefer to keep their heads
down, work hard, and stay away from conflict. This attitude proved prosperous
for them as a vassal state for centuries. Things have changed in recent years,
however, as Greade secretly aided [Illyria](/pages/Illyria) in their bid for
independence 25 years ago. That alliance gained Greade its freedom - but not all
Greadans are happy about that.
