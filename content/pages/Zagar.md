The Zagar are a race that mix humanoid and canine features. They are covered in short fur ranging from light yellow to black, and often patterned. Their legs are digitigrade, and their faces have snouts, resembling something between a hyena and a wolf. Zagar usually stand mostly upright, reaching between six and seven feet tall were they to stand fully erect. They are also able to run on all four limbs, and do so for increased speed or stability. Cunning and quick, a Zagar makes for a fearful opponent in almost any task they put their mind to.

In most other cultures, Zagar are considered bloodthirsty and savage, and they are perhaps more deserving of their reputation than the [Orkol](/pages/Orkol). While not necessarily an evil people, in most Zagar cultures it is common practice to take and keep other humanoids (or even Zagar from other tribes) as slaves. Some Zagar tribes even condone the practice of eating other sentient humanoids.
