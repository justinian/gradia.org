The LNTC is a rising trade company owned by Imka Tarik, of the wealthy Tarik
merchant family, in order to allow her to expand her trade empire beyond the Bay
of Kell, which her portion of the Tarik Trading Company limits her to. Imka was
approached by a wealthy investor and acts as her proxy. The seal of the LNTC is
a white on blue stag head, looking left, wreathed in laurels.

Headquartered in [Greade](/pages/Greade) but with reach across the continent,
the LNTC has bought out many of the other local trade companies in northern
Gradia.  They manage a large portion of trade throughout the Bay of Kell, and
even a significant portion further south to [Narin](/pages/Narin) and beyond.

Recently, a large portion of their activity seems to have gone to aiding the
[Awoken Eye](/pages/Awoken-Eye), transporting goods and supplies to aid in
building their camp and excavating [Var Gurum](/pages/Var-Gurum).
