Thalarion is called “The City of A Thousand Wonders” by many who visit this
incredible place. Built above a seemingly impenetrable wetland on a river delta,
Thalarion is rumored to be built on a magical nexus. Whether or not this is
true, the visitor to Thalarion will no doubt think of the city _itself_ as a
magical nexus. A tall, spired city, Thalarion is the pinnacle of magic and
engineering: it’s built in layers, suspended over each other and the wetlands
below.

In the vast expanse of this city can be found Gradia’s greatest sages,
philosophers, wizards, and all manner of other eccentric thinkers. The city
itself is a sort of magocratic republic; the most highly-regarded mages hold
seats on the Thalaric Council.

# Thalaric Council

The Thalaric Council is the ruling body of Thalarion. It is nominally made up of
the most powerful mages in the city, though the reality is much more political
than that. The council currently has five seats - it has had more or less over
its history, with the number being set by the council itself.

# The Thalaric City-States

The coastal lands to the south and east of Thalarion contain a number of smaller
cities and burgs that are nominally independent, but fall under the protection
of Thalarion and the Thalaric Council in exchange for tithes of food and
resources.
