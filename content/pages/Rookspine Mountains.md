The Rookspine Mountains, the longest and tallest range in Gradia, stretch from
[Uzan](/pages/Uzan) in the northwest to near [Alfheim](/pages/Alfheim) in the
southeast, effectively dividing the continent in half. These imposing peaks and
expansive ridges create a formidable natural barrier that has shaped the history
and cultures of the regions they bisect.

The mountains are traversed by five major passes: two between
[Narin](/pages/Narin) and [Greade](/pages/Greade), one between Narin and
[Illyria](/pages/Illyria), and two between [Corin](/pages/Corin) and Illyria.
These passes are critical trade routes and have been strategically fortified by
Narin military forces throughout history. During periods of strict Narin
control, many a smuggler has made their fortune finding alternate routes through
the Rookspine.

The Rookspine Mountains' significance extends beyond their physical presence.
They influence weather patterns and ecosystems, giving rise to the different
biomes on either side. Their role as a natural barrier has impacted migration,
military strategies, and trade, making them a major element of the continent's
geopolitical as well as physical landscape.
