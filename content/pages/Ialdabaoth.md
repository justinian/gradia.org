The Mad God, or the God of Madess, Ialdabaoth is not of this world. And yet, it is bound here by [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering). Ialtabaoth was called to Gradia by [Malat-ir](/pages/Malat-ir) in ancient times, bound by powerful magics in an effort to use its power to banish [Naarel](/pages/Naarel). But Malat-ir knew not what he brought into this world.

The few scholars who agree on the existence of Ialdabaoth - for even beliving in its existence is considered heresy by many sects - believe that it is fettered somehow, unable to bring its true power to bear in the world. Luckily so, as if it were to become free of its bonds, unthinkable horrors may await.
