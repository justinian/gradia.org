Zhoster is a human mage, and the current Primary of the [Thalaric Council](/pages/Thalarion). He is by far the oldest human on the Council - no one knows exactly how old he is, but he has held his seat for over a century. He looks to be of [Narin](/pages/Narin) or [Corin](/pages/Corin) descent, but no one knows for sure. Zosther also tends to act as the face of the Council, and is well-loved by the people, who see him as their benevolent protector.
