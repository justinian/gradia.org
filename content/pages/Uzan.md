The Uzan clans are the only peoples in the west to never have been conquered by the [Empire of Narin](/pages/Narin). They share a lineage and culture with their neighbors in [Greade](/pages/Greade), but the Greadans' culture became much more Narini under imperial rule. The Uzan, however, still embrace their old ways. Considered to be "barbarian hordes" by the empire, the border between Uzan and Narini lands has constantly shifted throughout the ages, as each side raided the other, and fought skirmishes for control of different border lands. But the Uzan may not the bloodthirsty savages the empire would have you believe, however - in their eyes, they are merely defending their ancestral lands from constant invasion. The Narini citizens they slaughter may have a different opinion, though.
