Hesta'Lorimar is the home and political center of a people known as the _Marshandi_, and their far-reaching merchant empire. The Marshandi culture has prized shipbuilding and naval longer than anyone can remember, and Marshandi can be found all over the known world because of it. Almost anywhere there is trade by sea, the Marshandi are a major influence. Some would argue that the same could be said for piracy.

The Marshandi are a proud but good-natured people. Light-hearted and peaceful, they strive to stay neutral in any national disputes. But culturally, they are perhaps most known for their jarring and cutting humor, which often leaves outsiders confused as to their true feelings.
