In the many centuries since [The Sundering](/pages/Sundering), religion has changed much in Gradia. Cut off from the powers of the outer planes, only the elemental gods and a handful of others remained. Thus, much of the continent follows some form of [Essentialism](/pages/Essentialism). But not all do.

The people of the [Empire of Xar](/pages/Xar) worhsip their immortal living god-queen, _Xar_. Whether she is actually a god, or even immortal, is debated by some scholars -- but certainly never when around any of her followers.

The [Einir](/pages/Einir) in [Eindonallan](/pages/Eindonallan) worship [Ysenenobeth, The Moon Queen](/pages/Essentialism#the-lady-of-the-moon) in her aspects of magic and wisdom as their highest deity.

And of course, in the deep and dark places, many of the subterranean peoples worship [Anloeb](/pages/Anloeb), the dark queen that demands they renounce all other gods.
