title: "Welcome to Gradia!"
---
Gradia is a homebrew setting for fantasy role-playing games that started with
the release of _Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition_ in 2000, as a simple map of two
nations, [Narin](/narin) and [Corin](/corin). Gradia has grown organically and
collaboratively with the help of GMs and players alike ever since.

Gradia is a very human-focused world. And, with some notable exceptions, it's a
fairly low-fantasy world as well. [Orcs](/orkol), [Elves](/einir), magic and
monsters exist - but most people have never seen anything magical, let alone
ever having met a wizard. Gods do grant their most devout followers powers akin
to minor miracles, but the common believers never have such experiences.

That's not to say that Gradia is a mundane world, though! Epic-worthy
adventures await those willing to look beyond the surface. Diverse cultures
co-exist while nations rise and fall and vie for power around them. How will
you shape the course of this land's history?
